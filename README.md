# Debate-Scoring-System-NLP
It scores the debate statements by counting the frequency of occured keywords and their synonyms and processing them using Natural Language processing.
It includes my part of code that consists of the scoring system.
To start the scoring we must put the relative content on the respective topic in for_the_motion.txt and against_the_motion.txt can be dont by scraping as well as manually.
The complete project includes front and back end and my part was integrated in the data processing part of back end.
front end was made on HTML, CSS and Javascript and backend is on python-flask.
Here i have tested my code using socket programming and is done in python as well and is scoring 2 different players.
